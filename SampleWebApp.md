# Sample Web Application #

The AdWords API PHP Sample Web Application has been created to show how the PHP client library can be used in a web environment, specifically leveraging OAuth for authorization.  The functionality is very limited for now, showing the client accounts, campaigns within an account, and the details of a campaign.  The [Angular](http://angularjs.org/) JavaScript framework was used for the AJAX UI, with PHP files used to interact with the API.
